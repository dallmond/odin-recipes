# odin-recipes

This project is my first HTML web page building project for The Odin Project. I am going to be building a recipe web page on my own, with limited help.

This project has taught me many things:
1. Boilerplate in HTML
2. Using different elements such as headings, bodies, anchor tags, images, etc.
3. It also has taught me how to use Git to save my code during different changes, that way I can control the version that I am on with my code

I look forward to continuing to update this series of recipe web pages as I become more experienced through The Odin Project.
